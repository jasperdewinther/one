?a
#This is function (as show by the ?) a, it is always the start of the program, just like main in c++.
p~1
#The character ~ defines a variable
#Note that functions and variabled share a global stack
#This means that you could overwrite functions with variables at runtime
p~p*9+5
#More complex expressions can also be done
#Do note that * and / do not have priority over + and -
r~p+äº†*äº†
#The last statement in the a function is the return value of the program
#In this case i define r as the last thing i do, and thus r is the return value



?äº†
#All default unicode characters are supported
#More complex unicode characters are not supported, such as colored emojis
ðŸ’ª~1
äº†~9
#This is legal syntax, however äº† can only be called once as a function. After that äº† is a variable
ðŸ’ª > äº†
#Comparisons can be done with <, = and >. This will run the expected check between two expressions.
#Depending on the result of the condition the next line will be executed or not.
l~100
#l will not be defined here as äº† is 9 and ðŸ’ª is 1.
ðŸ’ª*2 < 5*äº†
k~100
#The last command of a function is the return value of the function.
#If the last command of the function is not executed, the comparison will be returned, which is 0 (as the last command is not executed).



?b
#Recursion is also supported.
#But PLS do not make infinite recursion (like shown below) unless you have infinite ram.
